Example Maven project with Stored procedures in SQL, JavaFX, JDBC, and DAO pattern

This project exemplifies the following:
- DAO pattern applied to Java and JDBC for one entity (Employee)
- Calling stored procedures from a Dao class
- Custom exceptions for error handling

Setup
- Database schema is included in the resources/database folder
- Create a config file (.properties) under resources/config directory (ConnectionHandler.java expects one)

Enjoy!
